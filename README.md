# First_Website

This project is a fun web-based application which basically
has two parts. In the first part the website generates a
random quote based on a personâ€™s mood which will them be
voiced over by a moving animation in a funny tone. This will
be implemented using JS text-to-speech API and then by
changing the amplitude and pitch of the sound by using web
audio APIs.
The other part of this website will ask the user for an audio
input or an audio file like a song and it will similarly change
the amplitude and pitch of the sound and then play the
sound.
So, this web-based application can provide lots of fun to
someone with a simple interface.
